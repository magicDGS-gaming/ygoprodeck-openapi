  Error message
  
  Almost every parameter will now return an error code if an invalid value is passed to it (as opposed to ignoring it and returning all cards like in previous versions).
  The user will also be prompted on all the correct possible values to pass so they aren't left guessing.
  
  This should save users bandwidth on receiving large requests when requesting malformed urls.
