  Set information for a single card.
  
  This model contains properties that are exclusive from `cardinfo.php` or `carsetinfo.php` endpoints.
  
  You can now optionally use `tcgplayer_data` parameter.
  This model also contains the extra properties provided when `tcgplayer_data` parameter is present.  
  Using this will replace our internal Card Set data with TCGplayer Card Set Data.
      
  NOTE\: If using `tcgplayer_data`, we cannot guarantee that Set Names, Rairites and other info are correct.
  TCGplayer have occasionally made up Rarity names in the past and don't always conform to correct Card Set Names.
  A prime example of this is `Legend of Blue Eyes White Dragon` which TCGplayer lists as `The Legend of Blue Eyes White Dragon`.
