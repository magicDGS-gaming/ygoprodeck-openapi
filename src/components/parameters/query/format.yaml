  Filter by format of the cards (tcg, goat, ocg goat, speed duel, rush duel, duel links).
  
  Excluding the Format parameter will result in all Yu-Gi-Oh! cards excluding `rush duel`.
  
  _Note\: `duel links` is not 100% accurate but is close.
  Using tcg results in all cards with a set TCG Release Date and excludes Speed Duel/Rush Duel cards._
